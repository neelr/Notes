## Inverse Trig

-   can tell when function has inverse
    -   can tell by examinng graph
    -   continually increasing and decreasing
    -   inverse for trig would be a squiggly line
-   sin(x) limit domain so no repeat y val from $$\[frac{-\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}] $$
-   to isolate y, you take arcsin
-   get `y=arcsin(x)`
-   range becomes domain and vice versa
-   sin domain is [1,-1]

-   cos would need to be in the first and needs to have all possible values
-   would be from $$[0,\pi]$$

-   tan limit domain is then $$[\frac{\-pi}{2}], \frac{\pi/2}{2} ]$$
