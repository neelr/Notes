-   Vibrations create sound
-   closed end resonance == vibrating reed
-   open ended == flute w/ fluttering column of air
-   Frequency of sounds == pitch
-   Sound
    -   Longitudinal
    -   High and low pressure
    -   Compression and rarefraction
    -   needs a medium
        -   Any medium, best in elastic
        -   Gas > Liquid > Gas

-   Warm air is better than cold air
    -   Because warmer air bumps into each other more
-   Reflection of sound
    -   _echo_
    -   if too flat then reverbration
        -   garbles sound
    -   study is called **acoustics**
-   Uneven temperature winds cause sound to refract

-   energy is shown by amplitude
-   amplitude == loud
-   pitch == frequency
-   Natural Frequency
    -   different due to shape/material
    -   When force is applied to object
-   Resonance
    -   when frequency of forced vibrations == natural frequency a large increase in amplitude happens
-   interference
    -   Contructive/not
-   Beats
    -   2 slightly diff frequencies added together cause beats

-   Doppler Effect

    -   front and back of moving sound different
