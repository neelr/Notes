- anything moving back and forth is vibrating
- Wave is wiggle caused by a vibration/disturbance
	- Water wave
	- Pendulum
	- Light
	- Sound
	- etc.
- Pendulums swing back and forth, depends only on length
- Time back and forth is period (again **Does not depend on mass**)
- Waves

	- frequency == how often period in 1 second
	- hertz
	- frequency is inverse of period
	- 5hertz = 5 waves per second
- Wave speed
	- $$WaveSpeed = wavelength * frequency$$
- transverse waves
	- vibrating to right angles to direction of propagation
	- <img src="https://doggo.ninja/eIERgi.png"/>
- longitudinal waves
	- is parallel to propagation/same direction

- Wave behaviors
	- Reflection
		- change of direction when bounced off barrier
	- refraction
		- Change of direction of wave
	- diffraction
		- change in direction as they pass a barrier
	- interference
		- 2 waves meet each other and interact
		- causes a net effect on the particles
		- Add/subtract the waves in a place
		- Standing waves are interference that pass through each other
