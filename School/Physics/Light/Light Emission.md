- Light emission from electrons are from higher to lower energy states
- Each atom has a diffrent # of valence electrons
-  Can only have certain energies (called quantumn states)
-  Excitation
   -  electron has a greater electric potential energy farther from nucleus
   -  when electron moves to other level, it gets *excited*
   -  When an electron releases energy (photons/light) it lowers by a level
   -  Photon freqency == energy released
   -  $$ E = hf$$
   -  h is planks constant
   -  can use this to identify an element
-  Emission Spectra
   -  absorpsion == gain energy
      -  what did electron gain to change state
      -  Push white light through substance, and see what it takes to excite
   -  emission == lose energy
      -  what did it lose to change
      - Give lots of energy (will drop)
      - The take that light through a diffraction grate (prism)
      - then you'll see the lights emitted
