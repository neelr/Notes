- Absolute 0
	- Lowest possible
	- Turns into plasma
- Law 0
	- If 2 are in equilibrium with another 3rd, the 2 apart are in equilibrium
	- ![[law 0 thermo.png]]
- Law 1
	- No heat destroyed
	- flows from one system to another
	- Loss == Gain
	- `Heat added = increase in internal energy + external work`
- Law 2
	- Heat never flows from cold to hot
	- Always goes from hot to cold
- Heat Engine
	- Converts heat into work
	- Efficiency = 
		- $$Efficiency = \frac{T_{hot}-T_{cold}}{T_{hot}}$$
- Entropy
	- Order to disorder == entropy
	- disorganized energy can be changed with organizaional effort
