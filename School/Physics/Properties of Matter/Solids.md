- Crystal structure
- close together and ~ same distance
- proven through xray diffraction
- Structures
	- Crystalline
		- hard
	- Polycrystalline
		- plastics
		- aren't hard and brittle
	- Amorphous
		- Rubbers
		- no definite structure
- Density
	- How much matter in a volume
	- $$Density = \frac{Mass}{Volume}$$
	- same density regardless of colume
- Elasticity
	- change in size or shape when subjected to external forces
	- Like rubber band
	- if it returns to its original shape it is **Elastic** if not then it is **Inelastic**
	- Hooks Law
		- stretch is proportional to force
		- only applies within elastic limit (spring can't stretch forever etc.)
