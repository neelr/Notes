- Pressure is foce in a specific area
- Pressure in a liquid
	- force applied on an object by liquid
	- Depends on depth
	- salt water has less pressure
	- $$Liquid pressure = density * grav accel * depth$$
- Buoyancy
	- Loss of weight when in liquid
	- Support force by water
	- [[Atomic Nature of Matter]] shows it pushes against solid pushing it up
	- force vectors at side cancel out, vs gravity
	- Depends on density
	- Equal to the weight of water it displaces
- Liquids have different densities
- Pressure is consistent in all fluids (liquid + gas)

	- Can push heavy things
