# Speed

- speed = distance / time
- meter per second
- instantanteous speed
    - current speed
    - speed in d / t at a specific time
- Average speed
    - average speed over entire distance
    - no speed variations in this
    - whole distance / total time
- Constant speed: Steady speed
- Changing speed: â†’ acceleration
- speed vs velocity
    - speed is just dist and time
    - velocity is speed and direction
    - left at 5m/s, velocity is -5m/s
- Acceleration
    - rate at which velocity changes
    - Can be negative (no decelerate)
    - change in speed / time
    - derivative of speed
