- Projectile motion is a curved path of a combination of horizontal and vertical motion
- horizontal is independent of vertical
- horizontal velocity isn't affected by vertical force of [[Gravity]]

- horizontal speed is constant
- 45 deg is farthest
- complements are equal (59deg and 40deg)

## Orbits
- Keplers first law
	- all planets move in eliptical orbits with sun at one focus
- Second law of areas
	- ![[orbit area.png]]
	- All equal areas in equal time
- Third law of periods
	- Square of ratio of periods of 2 planets revolving the sun is equal to the cube of the average distances
	- $$(\frac{T_1}{T_2})^2 = (\frac{r_1}{r_2})^3$$
