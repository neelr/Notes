- Magnetic poles
  - North attract south
  - same repel
  - All magnets have 2 poles
- Magnetic Domains
  - cluster of aligned atons
  - every spinning electrons == magnet
  - when all spin together, it makes a strong magnet

  - left == unorganized
- Making Magnet
  - Organize electrons to rotate in one direction
  - stroking motions of another magnet can do it
- KE can unmagnetize a magnet (heat/impact)
- Magnetic Fields
  - produced by motion of electric charge
  - revealed by magnetic lines
  - go out of one pole and curve to other pole

- Earth
  - South pole is north magnetic and vice versa
- thumb rule
  - fingers == magnetic field
  - thumb == direction of current
- Magnetic field flows around electric current
- Looping electric current makes the magnetic field stronger

- Creates electromagnet
  - Uses electric current to create a magnet

  - w/out magnetic current, not a magnet
  - can use to move things
- Magnetic fields moving charged particles
  - <img src="https://doggo.ninja/LjI57g.png">
  - experiences deflecting force because the current has a magnetic force
