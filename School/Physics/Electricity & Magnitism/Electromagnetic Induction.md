-   elecric current can be created through moving magnet in coil of wire
-   induced voltage
-   more loops == more voltage
-   Faradays Law
    -   Voltage is proportional to product of loops and rate of change of mag field
    -   Loops and strength of magnet make more electricity
-   Generators and AC
    -   more practical to move coil than magnet
    -   rotating coil in mag field
    -   called a generator

    -   Generators are used in most power production
