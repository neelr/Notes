-   electric charge
    -   pos and neg
    -   pos == proton
    -   neg == electron
    -   Proton mas >>>> electron
    -   Proton charge == electron
    -   neutron no charge > proton
-   Electrical Forces

-   Conservation of Charge
    -   Neutral means equal protons and electrons
    -   If inequal, not neutral
    -   charged atom is called ion
    -   charge not destroyed, it is transferred/changed
-   Coulomb's Law
    -   The electrical force decreases inversly to distance
    -   Like gravity
-   Conductors
    -   Like heat
    -   conductor of electrical current
    -   same reason for good heat
    -   if electrons aren't free, its bad
    -   1-2 valence electrons
-   Insulator
    -   Electrons aren;t free
    -   doesn't conduct current well
    -   5-6 valence electrons
-   SemiConductors
    -   depends of temperature
    -   silicon is neither
    -   can be made to behave as either
-   Charging
    -   Friction
        -   causes heat and frees electrons
        -   easier current and loose electrons
        -   Balloon example
    -   Contact
        -   Charges transfer until equilibrium
        -   very positive/negative can take away electrons/protons
        -   Touching doorknob
    -   Induction
        -   repelling other type of electron can sort and charge

        -   neutral => charged
-   Electric Field
    -   Like grav force
    -   Mass is charge instead
    -   like a grav field, it is in space
    -   Pos charge
        -   Goes outward
    -   Neg charge
        -   Inward
    -   Coulombs
        -   STrength
    -   Example
        -   <img src="https://doggo.ninja/59aIWi.png">
-   Electric Potential
    -   Like pulling 2 magnets apart
    -   same way for Grav PE
