## Paragraph

The most interesting part about this article is the way it focuses on history as more of a lab, where you can look at test civilizations and effects of different actions. I feel this view is a great one, which allows people to improve upon past mistakes, and make informed descisions when implementing new policies that we can only speculate about. For world history, I'm really interested in studying about the political side of things, because it can provide us with answers to some of todays problems and difficulties. This is because we can analyze what past civilizations have done, and try to find parallels to our current day. I feel like that would be fun to do, and it would be interesting to see what we come up with.
