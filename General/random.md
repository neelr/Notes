***Question: Would you kill 2/3 of people in the most painful way possible, if it meant that you could become immortal? (assuming immortality is inability to die, and regeneration)***

## General

Basically what I'm saying is that with almost infinite possibilities (assuming singularities wouldn't expand again, almost 200 billion years), it would be possible for anything to happen. 

You could restart the human race, and build back those 2/3 of people. Assuming 2/3 of people die, then that means that leaves ~2 billion people left. Thats about the amount of people who lived in 1928 C.E, which means that people would regress a couple of years, with the supply and demand level lowered at a constant ratio. This would mean you could visit cultural sites and view human history.

Thats only a fraction of the possibilities though, you could go through space and hit an astroid, and try to colonize it. Brink spaceships back and forth from earth containing microorganisms. You could even just drift off into space until you hit a planet (assuming you do the math correctly, which you have a couple million years to check). You could also just drift into space and wait for an alien race to find you. The idea is that possibilities are endless with almost infinite time, which would be fun to see.

## AT: Mental Health

Assuming you can regenerate, you should be able to repair any damage caused by old age on your brain. So therefore any claim about you going insane from just living would be invalid. 

Though what could happen is being lonely. We’ve also seen that our we can change our ways of thinking to actually not care about human contact. There have been “
Hikikomori” who have had withdrawal from society for long periods of time, who haven’t killed themselves. Also with infinite time, you would have millions of years to adapt and think rationally.


## AT: Heat Death

That might happen in 200 billion years, which is an adequate time for almost anything. Its way larger than any person can even imagine, and even if it does happen, no one can tell what will happen next. Therefore that just gives a greater incentive to do it, because of the infinite probabilites.

## AT: Pain

Assuming you feel a lot of pain, then you should make the decision right now, because you weigh infinite pain against infinite possibilities. Then what you have to do is split the possibilities into with pain and without pain. Then since the total possibilities is greater than those with pain (assuming that at any one moment in the time you live, you wouldn’t feel pain), so you would choose the infinite probabilities.
