- Flow of charge
  - Ehen ends of conductor are different charges, electrons flow
  - the flow persists as long as there is a difference
- Electric Current
  - Flow of electrons == electric current
  - 1amp == 1 colomb per second
  - amp == amperes

  - $$ 6.2 * 10^{18} $$
- Difference between charges is potential difference, EMF, electromotive force
- Conventional Current
  - assume postice flows to negative
- Electrical Resistance
  - quality to reduce current of current
  - depends on
    - temperature
    - length
    - cross section
    - area
- Ohms Law
  - the current proportional to current
  - $$voltage = current * resistance$$
- Electric power
  - Watts
  - $$power = current * voltage$$
- Electric Circuit
  - Series
    - Run through multiple points
    - <img src="https://doggo.ninja/4T7v4r.png">
    - Less energy as it goes on, and drops proportional to resistance
  - Parallel
    - <img src="https://doggo.ninja/EELrOA.png">
    - more paths == less resistance
    - $$\frac{1}{resistance} = \frac{1}{resistance_1} + \frac{1}{resistance_2} + ...$$
    - Same voltage, different current
    - current divided among parallel branches
    - current can get very high
