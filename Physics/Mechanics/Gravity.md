- Everything pulls on everything that involves mass and distance
- $$Grav Force = \frac{constant*m_1*m_2}{d^2}$$
- greater mass == greater pull
- grav force == weight
- Farther it approches 0, but never is 0
- Tides are moons gravity
- Einstein
	- Gravity is a warp in 4d space time
	- greater mass == greater warp/bend
