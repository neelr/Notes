***2nd:*** Acceleration is produced by a net force on an object and is directly proportional to the magnitude of the force, in the same direction as the force, and is inversely proportional to the mass of the object.

- acceleration proportional to net force
    - 2 pple pushing car
- acceleration prop 1 / mass
    - pushing a bike vs a car

    $$\Sigma F=ma$$

- Friction force increases to opposing force?
    - there is a maximum friction force
    - not depend on speed, only surface
    - does not matter on surface of contact

    - Depends on roughness
    - more weight == greater support force â†’ more friction
- Types of Friction
    - Static Friction
        - cancelling applied force **at rest**
    - Kinetic friction
        - static friction > kinetic
        - acted on a moving object

### mass vs weight

- Mass == amount of matter (gram)
- Weight is force of gravity (Newton)
- Weight is 0 on moon because there is no gravity on the moon
- mass is the same in the moon as in earth
- pull by gravity == gravitational force == weight
- This accelerate when falling (gravitational acceleration)
- free fall is accelerating 10m/s/s

### gallelio gravity experiment

- things fall at a constant acceleration
- dropping a bowling ball and a tennis ball, both will hit at same time

***3rd:*** Every reaction has an equal and opposite reaction.

- rocket pushes down and up
- pushing a wall, wall pushes back at you
- pulling wall, wall pulls back
