- Conservation of energy
	- Initial energy == ending energy
	- Pendulum can't go higher than before bc of conservation of energy
	- Like [[Momentum]]
- Force applied is work
- Work = Force x Distance
- 50N in 2m is 100J of work
- Work is not including time
- Power takes into account time
- $$Power = \frac{work}{time}$$
- Work changes position or speed or both
- Work turns into mechanical force
- Work Energy Theorum
	- Amount of work is the mech energy smth has
	- 100J of work == 100J of mechanical energy
- Mechanical energy
	- 2 for now
	- Potential
		- off the ground has potential energy
		- Has the potential to exert energy
		- PE
		-  $$PE = mass * gravity * distance$$
		1. $$Work = F * Dist$$
		2. $$Work = Weight * Distance$$
		3. $$Work = Mass * Gravity * Distance$$
		- Work turns into potential energy, so you can replace that
		- Heavier == > PE
	- Kinetic
		- When you push an object it is moving
		- Thats kinetic energy
		- Mass and speed matter when energy is there
		- so the equation is
		- $$KE = \frac{1}{2}mass * speed^2$$
	- Total Mechanical Energy
		- You need to calculate both KE and PE and add them together
