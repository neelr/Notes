- [[Inertia]] resistance to move causes momentum
- Stay in motion 
-  greater Mass greater inertia and greater speed greater inertia
- Trucks are harder to stop than birds

    $$P = mv$$
	
- Momentum = mass x velocity
- **Object in motion tends to stay in motion**
- Impulse
	- Change in momentum
	- = final - initial momentum
	- Changes due to force
	- = Force x Time
- Conservation of Momentum
	- Net initial momentum = final momentum
	- ![[Conservation of Momentum.png]]
	- Cannon and cannonball example
		- Net initial momentum is 0 because cannon and ball aren't moving
		- after the cannonball is shot out at 500kg/s, the cannon has to have the same momentum but negative (other direction)
		- Thats why cannon is heavier
