- Atmosphere is caused by pull of gravity
- Atmospheric pressure is caused by weight of air
- Not uniform, but avg is ~1atm
- Ideal Gas Law
	- $$\frac{P*V}{T}_{before} = \frac{P*V}{T}_{after}$$
	- if temperature is constant then 
	- $$[P*V]_{before} = [P*V]_{after}$$
	- if pressure constant
	- $$[\frac{volume}{temp}]_{before} = [\frac{volume}{temp}]_{after}$$
		- less temperature == less volume
- Buoyancy of air
	- Seen with baloons
	- displace is heavier than itself
- Bernoulli principle
	- When speed of a fluid increases, the internal pressure decreases

		- High pressure goes to lower pressure
		- so ping pong ball gets sucked

- Plasma
	- Electrified gas
	- Sun is plasma
	- Electrons are free
