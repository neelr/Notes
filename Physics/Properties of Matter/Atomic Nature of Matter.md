- atoms are building blcoks
- perpetually moving
- Has protons electrons and neutrons
- proton is + electron is - neutron is neutral
- held together by strong nuclear forces
- Different shells
- Element is classified by number of protons
- Carbon
	- $$_{12}^{6}\mathrm{C}$$
-  $$_{atomic-number}^{atomic-mass}\mathrm{Element}$$
-  Left to roght is more electrons & protons
-  more shells (valence electrons)
-  Compounds = more than one kind of atom
- Mixture is w/out chem bonding
- Molecules are bonded (can be same)
- Antimatter
	- matter has atoms
	- has atoms with negative nuclei and pos electrons
	- positron is positive electron
	- antiprotons are negative protons
	- antiparticles are produced using nuclear accellerators
- Dark Matter
	- Unseen
	- know its there because of its gravitational pull
	- mysterious and ~27% of the universe
