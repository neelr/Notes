- Law of Reflection
  - Angle of incidence == angle of reflection
- Curved Mirrors
  - Concave
    - Converges at 1 focal point in front
  - Convex
    - diverges from focal point behind
    - gives a reduced and upright image
  - Diffuse Reflection

    - The light is reflected in many different directions
    - can be smooth for some waves and not for another
    - paper is rough for light, but smooth for a radio wave
  - Refraction
    - occurs when the ave speed of light changes from going through transparent mediums
    - Ex. Water in a cup
  - Lenses
    - Converging
      - Converge at one focal point
      - llike concave mirror
      - can be used to zoom in or reduced/inverted
      - used for glasses, microscopes, mag glass
    - Diverging
      - Diverg e from one focal point
      - reduced and upright image
      - Used in Telescopes, spy hole in dor etc
    - Defects
      - distortion is called aberration
      - more than 1 lens stops apperations
      - Spherical Aberration
        - doesn't converge at one point
      - Chromatic abberation
        - different speeds of colors cause them to separate

  - Huygen's Principle
    - every wave front can create others
    - IDEA: Wave fronts are made of of tiny wave fronts

    - Diffraction
      - Wave can pass through opening/barrier
      - if light goes through a slit, it diffracts, won't show the light on the back
    - Interference
      - combined amplitude
