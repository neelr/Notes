-   Light waves are electromagnetic waves
-   Light is a transverse wave
-   Polarization
    -   Filters waves

    -   Light every day is non polarized

    -   once light is polarized, its only 1 direction
    -   The more you tilt the polarizer, the less the intensity
        -   Proof of transverse wave

    -   If you shake a charged rod, you create electromagnetic waves

    -   Vibrating fields regenerate each other
    -   lowest frequency of light is red, highest is violet
    -   NOT Mechanical wave
        -   Can be in vacuum
    -   speed is 3e8 m/s
    -   longer to travel in denser mediums, but speed is constant
-   Colors of light
    -   Roy G Biv
    -   RGB Colored Light
-   REFLECTION
    -   We see objects because they reflect light
    -   Color is from the reflected light (not absorbed)
    -   reflects all other colors than the ones it resonates with
-   Why sky is blue
    -   short wavelengths get scattered by particles a lot more than others
-   Why sunset is red
    -   more atmosphere to go through
    -   The blue is already scattered, and red is there
-   Why clouds white
    -   clouds scatter all colors equally
