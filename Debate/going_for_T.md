- Comparison of models
- prove why the model of debate that alows for X is bad
- My limits offence outweighs
- Use your limit interp to solve theirs
- DO NOT BECOME A T HACK, just have it as a tool


## Impacts

1. Limits
    - How many affs fit in a limit
    - whether those limits are good or bad
    - Can't prepare affs which **moots** the negative
      - only things you can say are bad impact turns
      - only generics
      - can't prepare and reads generics and **no meaningful clash**
    - Depth
      - helps understand stuff better
    - To fix aff generics
      - Need aff flex to avoid generics
    - Stale debate
      - TRY to clash, and new things are good
      - Too much debate on generic things
    - prove limits by citing afirmatives
      - list affs are topical
    - functional limits
      - core generics make it so affs w/out x lose
        - ex. states cp, needs fed key warrant
2. Ground
   - removes key discussions good for education/fairness
   - losing states cp ex.
     - fed important for education
     - also w/out it no func limits
     - not abt research
3. Precision
   - Why you are credentially superior
   - mostly education which is why we should be policymakers
4. Predictabilty
    - Kinda bad
    - What is predictable?
    - is it average person vs debaters
    - kinda falls onto limits

### Weighing

- Strength of link
  - How you link to education and prove why it links
  - exclude 1 area vs like a billion new affs
  - who REALLY has a link to education/fairness
  - they underlimit the topic etc
- fairness vs education
  - why one outweighs the other
- side bias
  - prove how its harder for one side for another
  - then you help the biased side
- Roll of the side
  - Leverage education off side bias
  - ONLY EDUCATION from neg testing aff
  - only education is innovation of the affirmative
  - causes neg and aff offence

### Reasonability

- If we're close enough then just let us in
- Competing interps is based of offense defence
- Leads the neg to constantly read T
- don't vote neg unless its impossible to be negative
-
