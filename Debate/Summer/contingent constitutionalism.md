# Criminal law and variability

- Fourth amendment
    - up to local judges to decide what is warntless
    - Some places authorized, and some didn't
    - More legal authority == less freedom
    - they can make warantless arrests
    - Local police power leads to other misconduct and brutality
    - Local laws increase authority and add diversity to local laws
    - Local laws change fourth ammend reasonableness
- Sizth ammendment
    - changes locally
    - can be less or more punitive
    - Variablility in punishment, and also in definitition of crime

# Institutional design

- Benefits
    - allows state and local to be maintained
    - Connected to community and values
    - No "Dead Hand"
    - Norms stay where they are and don't spread (no risk to spread if bad)
- Detriments
    - variable rights
    - place determines your rights
    - fairness concerns
    - Hurts minorities because laws made by the majority
    - no self limiting

# New Understanding

- Myth of Rights Nationalism
    - Is national now
    - nationalism survived because its benificial
    - people are content to labor under a large body
    - knowing rights strengthens union and US
- Legal Spatiality
    - Laws have been imbued with the place in the past
    - Now that the US is regarded as a single space, the laws shoudl be the same
    - Now how it was back then
    - Dangers include zones where the consititution and norms don't apply
- Incorporations legacy
    - there has been a rise in nationalism and making federal laws
    - variability is declining, though isn't causing concern that its still there
