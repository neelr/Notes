# framework

- Resolution is in advance
  - assigned and should debate
  - resolution word creates policy change
  - "enact" and legislative
  - Why its good
    - we got it in advance and same expectations
    - egalitarian way to structure it
    - winrate ~50/50
    - I/L to many diff types of offence
    - predictable stasis point
    - engage in focused clash
    - Aff has tyo 
  - Fw important bc why focus on resolution is key
- ground. restricted to cjr policy policy allows for arguments
  - neg should get ground saying implementing bad, and hard for neg because interp is always different
  - 2ac gives caselist, but their ground is unpredictable
  - can change agent and caselist changes
  - DON'T KNOW HOW IT'LL EVOLVE
  - need plan to be clear
  - disensentives specific research against aff
  - incentive to fall back on absolutive strat which indites every affirmative
  - if the aff can get every kritical literature, the neg can't specifically refute them
  - aff bybasses all topicality so neg needs to make broad arguments
- can't debate everything, so we restrict it for clash
- that clash is good for us
- good in abstract, but ideal wont happen bc no clash

- truth testing
  - why neg should test aff advocacy
  - assume they are false because the neg couldn't test the aff was true
  - if not topical
- good education, but not portable until clash with neg, so predictability outweighs
- neg no need many cards
- switchside debate
  - unique about debate
  - good to know both sides of an issue
  - avoid echo chambers
  - good for aff
    - better to be read on neg
    - because its policy relavent, better links
  - if argument about identity more important than debate
    - DON'T USE SWITCHSIDE
  - disembodied 
  - aff responses
    - if switchside is true, you should be prepared to answer our aff
      - answer is that the neg refuses the aff, the aff doesn't say the neg is wrong
      - aff is usually defensive, you don't read frontlines
      - reading on neg is better for policy
    - reactionary bad
      - good because it forces k to be tailored to policy
      - debate is reactionary
    - procederal fairness
      - unifying goal is that we are trying to win
      - debate is a game
      - both sides need a fair chance then
      - fairness is an intrinsic good
      - ex. dropped arguments
      - i/l
        - game preservation
        - they cheated, they should lose
          - fairness is the only impact, and cheated, and since its a game they should lose
        - set precedent
          - not super convincing
        - moral hazard
        - make an explicit issue in the 2nc
          - fairness is not as compelling
          - ballott 100% solves procederal fairness, it doesn't solve racism
          - fairness
            - the debate is built on fairness (ex, dropped arguments etc)
            - it is debate
            - cx
              - give example where they got screwed by voting other team
            - not isolated from fairness
  - DEBATE IS A GAME
  - prep, pairings brackets, trophies etc
  - factually competitive academic
  - the game should be balanced
  - not a safe space.... why do we have a winner and loser
  - debate is a game, but more than that
    - learn about things
    - changes people
    - response
      - educational value maximized in one topic
    - still fairness is first
      - ex. speech times 
      - racism like breaking ttournament rules will get you kicked out
      - norm
        - rules are codified norms
        - same thing, we need it to stay fair
- give a topical version
- act as a cp that solves offense and having fairness as nb
  - no mutual exclusivity
  - doesn't need to solve, but allows them to read literature base
  - if they say its bad
    - neg ground
    - if education so good, then you can lose every debate and educate everyone
  - TBA is middle ground
  - just give one, and give itt in the 2nc/1nc
  - ex
    - framing contention
    - negative to take action
    - look at thir links for ideas
  - don't ham cards
  - responses
    - only would go for election and politics
      - answer
        - good to talk about elections and politics
        - most people know it should be reformed, question is how
        - not EVERYONE
        - give ex of neg strat



## answers

  - how does judge vote
  - the plain answer is to choose the better debater
  - ballot is only fairness, because debate is a game
  - creates referendums
  - weird for judges to make descisions on identities of 16 yr olds
  - no basis
  - one round doesn't change anything
- fiat bad
  - alt is a hypothetical
  - cannot discuss anything that is in the future
  - cannot discuss school etc
  - word should is resolutional
  - give c/i
  - does their interp follow the resolution?
  - interp is a **interp** of the resolution
  - moral hazard for aff because they need to select a random c/i, air neg
  - strategic to change c/i after neg offense to solve
- direction of the resolution
  - they usually don't meet their c/i
  - biderectional
  - just about cjr, then horrible for neg
  - identity
    - bad to disclose this
    - some people don't want to disclose/might be dangerous
  - c/i only our aff
    - arbitrary, worse than any c/i
- debate is bad
  - why are you here bro
  - clash is a defense of debate
  - fairness bad voter for this
- policy debate produces bad pple
  - reading a blan doesn't shape subjectivity
  - you make more choices in life other than debate
  - hard to draw a causal relation
  - arguments in debate don't shape us
- why would you win
  - we would lose if we were aff
  - no neg strat
- teams are running k affs now, non-unique
- predictability bad
  - not specific to debate
  - nott in context of resolution
  - we need it to clash
  - lashout is the alt
  - inevitable
    - pairings
    - affs
    - disclosure
    - etc
- aff will outprep on few things
- limits bad
  - yes, but we can't operationalize wiiyjout clash
  - speech times inevitable
  - none will be learned because no in depth diiscussion
- debate iis a survivial strat
  - need to understand costs and risks
  - debate is the only way to teahc this as a skill
  - answers
    - ballot isn't necessary to do that
    - enforces the negative to negate survival strategues
    - makes debate hostile
    - bad ro present blach survival strategy white white judges
    - usually not actaually believing it
- micropolitics key 
  - grassroots activism
  - answer
    - debate gives you skills to do that
    - no way for aff to make those skills
- fairness to people bad
  - any big school can cut aff and win
  - if you can cut any aff, then big schools always win
  - give examples of schools
- words don't have a fixed meaning
  - ballot doens't say if res is true of false, just true or false
  - if the ballot was true, then we would only giev truth descisions, no tech
  - definitions aren't violent, communal agreement
  - leads to exclusion

## Writing your framework file

- write your own blocks as a 2n
  - internalizes arguments
  - ethos in debate
- diff shells
- read 1ac and understand it
- procederal fairness
- picture 1nc args
  - 1n FIND TOPICAL VERSIONS
  - contexualize well
- Run something like a capk or da
- whats their best offense?
- ab
  - patholigization
- answer new aff offense
  - say whatever they say is bad say is good etc
  - does the counterinterp resolve this?
  - this offense is not intrinsic to reading a plan
    - other structures in debate
    - bad people and practices
      - nothing against reading a topical plan
      - view voting neg as a topicality good cp, that pics out of what they critisize
  - inevitable
    - makes patholigizations
  - question the aff ev
    - if its a metaphor about gulf war, not abt debate
- make a cx strat
  - why vote aff
  - might be a link to T
  - go through un-highleted versions of cards and ask in cx
    - BE RIGHT
  - what they are critisizing
    - good to see impact turns on fw
  - do they defend a material alt?
  - not for start but: question that gets to the point of why objective evaluation is good
    - why are dropped arguments true?
- if there is nothing
  - search the article and look for mentions that critisize the article
