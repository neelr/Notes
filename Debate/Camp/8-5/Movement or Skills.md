# Movement of Scales Framework

-   Fairness is easy
-   Institutional racism
-   Black debate argument
    -   regardless if they win the substance, its important for them to win, to advance
    -   Don't go for fairness
-   defending against crafted proposals make them able to
    -   Well versed with legal concepts
    -   Able to navigate well prepared opposition (clash)
    -   formulate hypothesis and test them (good researcher to test)
-   people who do debate go into politics and places of power
-   its important for them to test ideas
    -   importan for fairness and equality
-   john yu
    -   supported trumps book
    -   wrote justifications of torture of bush
    -   legally why its ok to torture innocents
-   Neal Katyal
    -   argued in front of the supreme court
-   Contrast ones that work vs ones that didn't
-   Strikes in Paris, weren't able to create a real government
-   **Debaters can draw an internal link to a movement**
    -   against identity K's
    -   NOt against High Theory because it has impact turns for politics
-   Fairness DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK
-   Will lose a lot of K Aff's
    -   Because the defence isn't warranted
-   Gives you the ability to defend the structure of the game as it exists
-   not neccessarily for fairness
-   that way learning about bolitics is good
-   Its okay to be anapolegetically black in debate
    -   response: why the game is good and the game is good
-   That way you can weigh the game with this
-   AT: Can't prove policy debate did it
    -   Linearly yes
    -   usually won't matter
    -   all you need is a theory
    -   if you explain the link well, you won't lose on no internal link
    -   all about perception, snappy answers important
    -   Prepared to beat you in 2 ways
        -   Debate changes us
        -   debate changes us in a bad way
        -   Debate never shapes us
            -   Unwinnable
            -   debate changes our subjectivity
                -   Now you debate how it changes you subjectivity
            -   movements in more coherrent than what they giev
-   Easier ex. debate the K is easier with a big stick aff
    -   Movement arguments can cause external impacts that are large
    -   can fall back on offence is larger

## Possible arguments

-   pathologization disad
    -   Those who engage in debate are legally knowlagable
    -   taht implies others who debate aren't
    -   bad
    -   IMPACT
        -   Bad Stereotypes
    -   Kritiks that topicality has said the the aff isn't legally educated
    -   not content, its form
    -   Form arguments are about the form, something you said
    -   how you present it
    -   kritik forces them to read a plan, and by doing that you call them legally stupid
    -   by judging peoples proposals based on them (form)
        -   Best its
        -   worst its authoritarian
        -   alternative is to insulate them from critisism
            -   This allows for black conservativism which is bad
        -   if they give a caselist, its still bad form
        -   carl row
            -   Policy debate creates a bad person
            -   he wanted to make war
            -   some skills through policy is bad for some people
-   blackness engaging with usfg is bad for moral
    -   movement, gives legal expertise to black people to fix it
    -   non-unique, people will still do bad things after debate
    -   debate is very progressive, and won't produce conservatives
    -   even if, plan based debate probably doesn't do that
-   Elites bad, don't learn elite language
    -   progressive movements use connections with elites to do stuff
    -   like slavery and alabama bus supremem court
    -   alt allows elites to do whatever with the power,
-   New args
    -   link turn offence
        -   almost always solve the impact to the aff
    -   always say what they condemn, can be used strategically for good purposes
        -   Full scale abolish bad
        -   iteratively test idea
    -   does their interp solve it
        -   their k has to solve
        -   does their kritik affect debate, or just plan based debate
        -   if its debate, there is still debate, the neg must respond
    -   Get in the logic of the debate, and kritik mindset
        -   **DO NOT JUMP INTO FAIRNESS**
        -   impact turn the logic
    -   CX IS VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT
        -   they'll ask why plan causes movements
        -   having history of people who have left debate
        -   gives a factual basis

*   BaD PEOPLE HAVA REASON FOR DOING BAD THINGS
    -   not debate

SHELL

-   to show it requires policy
    -   usfg
        -   NOT ERICKSON
    -   enact
    -   reform is policy
        -   because the counterinterp is not usfg
        -   if you get these, then their counterinterp doesn't work
-   Then cards from lakey and han
-   why the aff won the debate
-   If fairness doesn't matter, there is no debate
